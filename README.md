# Project-Woodlawn
Allow a user to locate gravesites for historical figures and save them to a profile


# Goal
Implement a mobile friendly web-site application that allows the user to utilize google maps to view historical figures. Will provide
the user with login and authentication.

# First two weeks:
 - Create google maps account
 - Create google app engine account
   - Assuming these are both under one google account
   - Need to know pricing
   - might also want to look into alternate google app engine services (microsoft azure, redhat openshift server, octopus, ...)
 - Software:
   - Determine language to use (leaning towards java)
   - Draw out initial software structure (login pages, communication between front and back-end, database, ...)
   - Start learning how to create a webpage using java and what tools we will need
     - First prototype won't be using google app engine or google maps yet. Too much work to figure out so soon
   - Start coding front-end GUI stuff (login page for an administrator and one for a user)
   - Google and research fastest and easiest way to implement a back-end for the server part
   
   ## Language
 - Backend: Java
 - Frontend: 
   - JSP (Java Server Pages): might be worth looking into, but seems complicated and I don't think it's used much anymore
   - HTML, CSS, Javascript
   - Need to do more research on both of these to figure out the best solution
 - Middleware: (communication between front and back-end)
   - Spring might be the best/easiest option; Will have to do some research on this as well.
   - Can also look at using SOAP
 - Google Maps API
